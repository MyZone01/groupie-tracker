#   ðŸŽ¤ GROUPIE TRACKER
##  DESCRIPTION
This project consists on receiving a given API and manipulate the data contained in it, in order to create a site, displaying the information.

- It will be given an [API](https://groupietrackers.herokuapp.com/api), that consists in four parts:
    - The first one, `artists`, containing information about some bands and artists like their name(s), image, in which year they began their activity, the date of their first album and the members.
    - The second one, `locations`, consists in their last and/or upcoming concert locations.
    - The third one, `dates`, consists in their last and/or upcoming concert dates.
    - And the last one, `relation`, does the link between all the other parts, `artists`, `dates` and `locations`.
- This project also focuses on the creation of events/actions and on their visualization.
    - The event/action we want you to do is known as a client call to the server (client-server). We can say it is a feature of your choice that needs to trigger an action. This action must communicate with the server in order to receive information, ([request-response])(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response)
    - An event consists in a system that responds to some kind of action triggered by the client, time, or any other factor.
